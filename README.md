# A-Shell
A simple Unix shell

This is a project to make my own Unix shell. My main goal is to get it running vim well.

I am also creating a [terminal emulator](github.com/adhfmz7/termu)

## Ash shell
The ash shell is a minimal Unix shell that will implement the basic commands such as,
- running programs
- file redirection
- input/output piping

TODO: 
- Implement ~
- Implement pipes
- Add some kind of [readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline) utility

## Terminal Emulator
work will begin when shell is completed.

## Goals
- Tab completion

# em-term
A simple Unix terminal emulator

This is a project to make my own terminal emulator and a Unix shell. My main goal is to get it running vim well.

## Ash shell
The ash shell is a minimal Unix shell that will implement the basic commands such as,
- running programs
- file redirection
- input/output piping

TODO: 
- Implement ~
- Implement pipes
- Implement redirection 


## Goals
- OpenGL rendered

A simple Unix shell

This is a project to make my own Unix shell. My main goal is to get it running vim well.

This is a project to make my own terminal emulator and a Unix shell. My main goal is to get it running vim well.

I am also creating a [terminal emulator](github.com/adhfmz7/termu)

The ash shell is a minimal Unix shell that will implement the basic commands such as,
- running programs
- file redirection

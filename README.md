# A-Shell
A simple Unix shell

This is a project to make my own Unix shell. My main goal is to get it running vim well.

## Ash shell
The ash shell is a minimal Unix shell that will implement the basic commands such as,
- running programs
- file redirection
- input/output piping

TODO: 
- Implement ~
- Implement pipes

## Terminal Emulator
work will begin when shell is completed.
It is now hosted [here.](https://www.github.com/adhfmz7/termu)

## Goals
- OpenGL rendered
- Tab completion
